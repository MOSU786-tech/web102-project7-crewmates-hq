# Web Development Project 7 - Crewmates HQ

Submitted by: **Mohammad Sultan**

This web app: **A Supabase-powered crewmate manager where users can create, view, update, and delete crewmates. The app includes unique detail pages per crewmate, category-based attribute restrictions, summary statistics, and a custom crew success metric that changes the gallery presentation.**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The web app contains a page that features a create form to add a new crewmate**
  - Users can name the crewmate
  - Users can set the crewmate's attributes by clicking on one of several values
- [x] **The web app includes a summary page of all the user's added crewmates**
  - The web app contains a summary page dedicated to displaying all the crewmates the user has made so far
  - The summary page is sorted by creation date such that the most recently created crewmates appear at the top
- [x] **A previously created crewmate can be updated from the list of crewmates in the summary page**
  - Each crewmate has an edit button that will take users to an update form for the relevant crewmate
  - Users can see the current attributes of their crewmate on the update form
  - After editing the crewmate's attribute values using the form, the user can immediately see those changes reflected in the update form and on the summary page
- [x] **A previously created crewmate can be deleted from the crewmate list**
  - Using the edit form detailed in the previous _crewmates can be updated_ feature, there is a button that allows users to delete that crewmate
  - After deleting a crewmate, the crewmate should no longer be visible in the summary page
- [x] **Each crewmate has a direct, unique URL link to an info page about them**
  - Clicking on a crewmate in the summary page navigates to a detail page for that crewmate
  - The detail page contains extra information about the crewmate not included in the summary page
  - Users can navigate to the edit form from the detail page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] A crewmate can be given a category upon creation which restricts their attribute value options
  - User can choose a `category` option to describe their crewmate before any attributes are specified
  - Based on the category value, users are allowed to access only a subset of the possible attributes
- [x] A section of the summary page displays summary statistics about a user's crew on their crew page
  - Example included: total crewmates, average speed, average stamina, ready-for-launch percentage, and dominant category
- [x] The summary page displays a custom "success" metric about a user's crew which changes the look of the crewmate list
  - Example included: a computed crew success score that applies an `elite`, `steady`, or `scrappy` board theme

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Live preview panel on the create/edit form that updates in real time
- [x] Readiness label and score for each crewmate
- [x] Shareable URL display on each crewmate detail page
- [x] Polished responsive UI with custom styling and accessibility-friendly keyboard navigation on crewmate cards

## Notes

Main challenge areas were wiring Supabase correctly for a Vite app (using `VITE_` env variables), setting up row level security policies, and making sure CRUD updates reflected immediately across summary/detail/edit views.

## Mentor Tips (Commented)

```js
// 20+ year backend mentor tip:
// Keep schema setup idempotent (CREATE IF NOT EXISTS + policy existence checks)
// so you can re-run setup safely in new environments.

// Production mindset:
// Keep client env vars in .env.local and only commit .env.example templates.
// Never commit service-role keys to frontend repos.

// Data integrity first:
// Put validation in BOTH places:
// 1) UI validation for user experience
// 2) DB constraints/checks for data correctness

// CRUD reliability trick:
// After write actions (create/update/delete), redirect to a page that re-queries
// source-of-truth data, instead of trusting stale local state.

// Future scale tip:
// Add migrations early (Supabase CLI) when projects get larger than one SQL file.
// It saves pain when you need rollback/history.
